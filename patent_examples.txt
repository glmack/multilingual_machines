reference_human1_sentence   The training corpus extracted from a log can be used 
to train the language model, or the common lexicon can be sorted by 
segmenting and counting text in the log.
reference_human1_summary    The invention discloses a machine processing and
text error correction method and device, a computing device, and a
storage medium, specifically comprising corrected and rewritten text
pairs of incorrect  text and corresponding correct text. The corrected
and rewritten text pairs serving as a training corpus to train the
machine processing model, thereby preparing a machine processing model
suitable for text error correction. Through extraction of corrected and
rewritten text pairs from a log, the machine processing model can be
trained and thus made fit for text correction by inputting the first text
into the machine processing model to get the second text, that is the
error correction result text. In addition, the language model or the
common lexicon can be used to determine whether the first text needs to
be corrected. The training corpus extracted from a log can be used to
train the language model, or the common lexicon can be sorted by
segmenting and counting text in the log. This is how to easily implement
text error correction.
reference_human2_sentence   It can use the practice language material gathered 
from the diary or daily journal to train the language model, and it can
also initialize the common vocabulary bank through the segmentation and
analysis of the diary or daily journal text
reference_human2_summary"   This invention makes public a machine processing and
text error correction method and hardware, computing equipment and storage 
medium, and specifically pairs error text with the corresponding corrected 
and modified correct text. It uses this text pair as training material for 
the machine processing model, and from there prepares the machine processing
model that is applied to the text correction. It can train the machine processing
model using a diary or daily journal and make it suitable for text correction.
The first text version is inputted into the machine processing model to get 
the second text version, which is the corrected text. Additionally, it can 
also use a stored language model or common vocabulary bank to determine if 
the first text version needs correction. It can use the practice language 
material gathered from the diary or daily journal to train the language model,
and it can also initialize the common vocabulary bank through the segmentation
and analysis of the diary or daily journal text. Through all this, text 
correction is conveniently implemented.
candidate_google_sentence   The language model can be trained using the training 
corpus extracted from the log, or the common lexicon can be organized by 
segmenting and counting the text in the log.
candidate_google_summary    The invention discloses a machine processing and
text error correction method and device, a computing device and a
storage medium, and particularly comprises an error correction
rewriting pair of an error text and a corresponding correct text, and
an error correction rewriting pair as a training corpus, and a machine
processing model. Training is performed, thereby preparing a machine
processing model suitable for text correction. The machine processing
model can be trained to mine the error correction by mining the error
correction rewrite pair from the log. The first text is input into the
machine processing model to obtain a second text, that is, an error
correction result text. In addition, you can use the language model or
common lexicon to determine whether the first text needs to be corrected.
The language model can be trained using the training corpus extracted
from the log, or the common lexicon can be organized by segmenting and
counting the text in the log. Thereby, text correction is facilitated.
candidate_wipo_sentence The training corpus extracted from the log can be 
used to train the language model and also, through text segmentation and 
statistical analysis of text in the log compile a lexicon of commonly 
used words.
candidate_wipo_summary  The present invention discloses a machine processing and text correction method and device, 
computing equipment and a storage medium. Specifically comprising corrected and rewritten text pairs of incorrect 
text and corresponding correct text, the corrected and rewritten text pairs serving as a training corpus for training
a machine processing model, and in this way developing a machine processing model for use in text correction. 
Through extraction of corrected and rewritten text pairs from a log, the machine processing model can be trained 
and thus made fit for text correction by inputting a first text into the machine processing model to obtain a second
text i.e. a corrected text result. Moreover, a language model or a lexicon of commonly used words can be used to 
assess whether text needs correction. The training corpus extracted from the log can be used to train the language 
model and also, through text segmentation and statistical analysis of text in the log compile a lexicon of commonly 
used words. Thus, text correction can be made easier and more convenient
