    "Does your machine learn in Chinese? 您和您的機器學習中文嗎? I don’t speak a word of Mandarin or Cantonese so Google Translate gets all the credit — good or bad — for the preceding sentence. But how might a researcher quickly evaluate the quality of this machine translation? This question encapsulates the basic challenge that gives rise to the BLEU metric. BLEU, which stands for bilingual language understudy, is the default measure of machine translation quality and is also sometimes applied to more general cross-lingual approaches to natural language processing (NLP). The metric is well-established in the machine translation space but some analysts also question the application to a wider set of NLP tasks beyond the original purpose for which the algorithm was developed. This article explores these issues by briefly discussing basic lessons and limits of BLEU using examples drawn from the multilingual space of global patent documents."

    "BLEU is an adjusted measure of precision of the overlap of word sequences between a “candidate” machine translation and one or more “reference” human translations. Conceptualizing the algorithm at the unit of a machine-translated sentence, BLEU counts the maximum number of times that word sequences, expressed by the term n-grams, occur in human-translated sentences. The adjusted counts of each n-gram in the sentence are summed and the number is then “adjusted” by dividing by the total (unclipped) number of n-grams in the candidate text. "

    "The BLEU score is as a number between 0 and 1, where 0 represents the complete absence of overlap in n-grams between candidate and reference texts, and where 1 might equal a machine translation that is exactly similar to one of the reference texts. While this example considers BLEU at the level of the sentence, the actual evaluation of a machine translation is calculated by averaging out sentence scores across an entire corpus and adjusting this aggregate metric to account for the typically-longer word lengths of machine translations. If you’re interested in learning more, you might learn to calculate BLEU in a fifteen-minute video by Andrew Ng of DeepLearning.Ai. To make learning BLEU more tangible, I begin with machine translations and human translations of Chinese text"

As we saw above, BLEU allows for candidates to be compared against multiple references but some researchers also suggest that BLEU's allowable variation in translation goes further than it should [5]. As one researcher suggests, \"BLEU may also allow variations that would receive varied human evaluations but which BLEU scores in the same score… [and] may not correlate with human judgment to the degree that it is currently believed to do. (Callison-Burch). Significant variation, some of which may be of lower quality, but with the same BLEU scores [4]. The authors argue \"that there are instances when an improvement in Bleu is not sufficient to reflect a genuine improvement in translation quality, and in other circumstances that it is not necessary to improve Bleu in order to achieve a noticeable improvement in translation quality.\" [3]"

When conducting a structured literature review, some researchers argue that BLEU–human correlations, and suggest that whether BLEU correlates with human evaluations is very dependent on the details of the systems being evaluated, the exact corpus texts used, and the exact protocol used for human evaluations. (Reiter). As a surrogate endpoint, Reiter argues that BLEU is useful only if such scores \"reliably predict an outcome that is of real-world importance or is the core of a scientific hypothesis we wish to test.\" Reiter finds that none of the \"surveyed papers used real-world human evaluations; that is, they all used human evaluations performed in an artificial context (usually by paid individuals, crowdsourced workers, or the researchers themselves), rather than looking at the impact of systems on real-world users.\" Given these absence of validated findings on BLEU, Reiter calls for A/B tests of correlations between their A/B tests and BLEU (?). \"the results of real-world A/B testing could be used to determine contexts in which BLEU reliably had good correlation with real-world effectiveness.\""

Reiter argues that this is because of concerns about the validity and reliability of BLEU. \n",
