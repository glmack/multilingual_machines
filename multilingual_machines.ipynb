    "Does your machine learn in Chinese? I don't speak Mandarin or Cantonese so Google Translate gets all the credit \\- good or bad \\- for translating the preceding sentence into: \"您和您的機器學習中文嗎?\" But how might a researcher quickly evaluate the quality of machine translations? This question encapsulates the basic challenge that gives rise to the BLEU metric. BLEU, which stands for bilingual language understudy, is a default measure of machine translation quality and is also sometimes applied to cross-lingual natural language processing (NLP) tasks. The metric is well-established in the machine translation space but some analysts question its application to a wider set of NLP tasks beyond the original purpose for which the algorithm was developed. This article explores lessons, implementations and limits of BLEU using examples drawn from multilingual patent documents."

    "BLEU is an adjusted precision measure of the overlap of word sequences between a “candidate” machine translation and “reference” human translations. BLEU is a measure of precision in that it counts \"n-grams\", word sequences of length n, of a machine translation that match the n-grams in a human translation and divides by the number of n-grams in the machine translation. The measure is adjusted in the sense that it \"clips\" the n-gram count to the maximum number of n-gram occurrences in a human translation and penalizes machine translations that diverge in word length from the reference translation."

    "The resulting BLEU score is as a number between 0 and 1, where 0 represents the complete absence of overlap n-grams between candidate and reference texts, and where 1 might equal a machine translation that is exactly similar to one of the reference texts. In practice, this measure typically combines a range of word sequence lengths - 4-grams (four-word sequences), tri-grams (three-word sequences), bi-grams (two-word sequences), and uni-grams (one-word sequences) - via a geometric means of the respective n scores. While the algorithm is designed for comparisons at the level of a document, BLEU calculates n-grams at the basic unit of a sentence and then averages out sentence scores across an entire document of sentences. To make the metric more tangible, you can practice applying BLEU to translations of Chinese-language patents."

    "There is a general consensus that BLEU is expedient for diagnostic evaluation of machine translation systems but some researchers suggest that BLEU may not be appropriate for certain types of translation and NLP tasks. One critique raised by researchers is that BLEU's flexibility with respect to allowed variation in translations may result in documents of differing quality that nonetheless score the same on the BLEU metric [4]. The authors argue \"that there are instances when an improvement in Bleu is not sufficient to reflect a genuine improvement in translation quality, and in other circumstances that it is not necessary to improve Bleu in order to achieve a noticeable improvement in translation quality.\" [3] BLEU may also not be appropriate for comparisons of machine learning systems that employ significantly different strategies. Callison-Burch argue that inappropriate uses for Bleu include: 1) comparing systems which employ radically different strategies (especially comparing phrase-based statistical machine translation systems against systems that do not employ similar n-gram-based approaches). 2) trying to detect improvements for aspects of translation that are not modeled well by Bleu, and 3) monitoring improvements that occur infrequently within a test corpus.
