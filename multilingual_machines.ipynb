    "Does your machine learn in Chinese? I don't speak Mandarin or Cantonese so Google Translate gets all the credit \\- good or bad \\- for translating the preceding sentence into: \"您和您的機器學習中文嗎?\" But how might a researcher quickly evaluate the quality of machine translations? This question encapsulates the basic challenge that gives rise to the BLEU metric. BLEU, which stands for bilingual language understudy, is a default measure of machine translation quality and is also sometimes applied to cross-lingual natural language processing (NLP) tasks. The metric is well-established in the machine translation space but some analysts question its application to a wider set of NLP tasks beyond the original purpose for which the algorithm was developed. This article explores lessons, implementations and limits of BLEU using examples drawn from multilingual patent documents."

    "BLEU is an adjusted precision measure of the overlap of word sequences between a “candidate” machine translation and “reference” human translations. BLEU is a measure of precision in that it counts \"n-grams\", word sequences of length *n*, of a machine translation that match the n-grams in a human translation, and then divides by the number of n-grams in the machine translation. The measure is adjusted in the sense that it \"clips\" the n-gram count to the maximum number of n-gram occurrences in a human translation and penalizes machine translations that diverge in word length from the reference translation."

    "The resulting BLEU score is as a number between 0 and 1, where 0 represents the complete absence of n-gram matches between candidate and reference texts, and where 1 might equal a machine translation that is exactly similar to one of the reference texts. In practice, this measure typically aggregates multiple word sequence lengths \\- 4-grams (four-word sequences), tri-grams (three-word sequences), bi-grams (two-word sequences), and uni-grams (one-word sequences) \\- via a geometric means of the respective n scores. While the algorithm is designed for comparisons at the level of a document, BLEU calculates n-grams at the basic unit of a sentence and then combines sentence scores across an entire document of sentences. To make the metric more tangible, you can practice applying BLEU using translations of Chinese-language patents."

    "There is a general consensus among researchers that BLEU is expedient for diagnostic evaluation of machine translation systems but some researchers caution suggest that BLEU may not be appropriate for certain types of translation and NLP tasks. One critique is that BLEU's flexibility in allowing variation in translations may result in documents of differing quality that nonetheless score the same on the BLEU metric [1]. The authors argue that \"there are instances when an improvement in BLEU is not sufficient to reflect a genuine improvement in translation quality, and in other circumstances that it is not necessary to improve BLEU in order to achieve a noticeable improvement in translation quality.\" [3] BLEU may also not be appropriate for comparisons of machine learning systems that employ significantly different strategies. Callison-Burch argue that inappropriate uses for Bleu include: 1) comparing systems which employ radically different strategies (especially comparing phrase-based statistical machine translation systems against systems that do not employ similar n-gram-based approaches). 2) trying to detect improvements for aspects of translation that are not modeled well by Bleu, and 3) monitoring improvements that occur infrequently within a test corpus. Some researchers suggest that BLEU is not appropriate for wider tasks, such as for evaluation of individual texts, or for scientific hypothesis testing [6]."

(Reiter). As a surrogate endpoint, Reiter argues that BLEU is useful only if such scores \"reliably predict an outcome that is of real-world importance or is the core of a scientific hypothesis we wish to test.\" Reiter finds that none of the \"surveyed papers used real-world human evaluations; that is, they all used human evaluations performed in an artificial context (usually by paid individuals, crowdsourced workers, or the researchers themselves), rather than looking at the impact of systems on real-world users.\" Given these absence of validated findings on BLEU, Reiter calls for A/B tests of correlations between their A/B tests and BLEU (?). \"the results of real-world A/B testing could be used to determine contexts in which BLEU reliably had good correlation with real-world effectiveness.\" Reiter and others argue that researchers should approach BLEU as a diagnostic for machine translation at the system level, but not as an evaluation technique to measure the output of a system. Reiter finds that \"the evidence does not support using BLEU to evaluate other types of NLP systems (outside of [machine translation), and it does not support using BLEU to evaluate individual texts rather than NLP systems.\" Reiter argues that BLEU should not be the primary evaluation technique of NLP papers. Reiter argues that this is because of concerns about the validity and reliability of BLEU. \n",
